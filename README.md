# CrossSection_nTuple
Creating an nTuple for general-topology analysis work

#GunParticlePID
Using PIDA and chi^2 methods to determine PID on particle gun events

Used on muons and protons to check they match the work done by Tom in summer 2017: SBN-doc-3467-v1

Distributions are located in pg_plots

# ParameterFinding
Writing particle and event information into various nTuples for use in a reconstruction-based event selection tool
